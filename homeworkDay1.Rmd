### R Markdown Syntax


demonstrate your R Markdown skills.

1.calculate `var(x)` and `mean(x)`

```{r calculate_homework, cache = TRUE}
n=100
x=rnorm(n)
hist(x,col = "pink")


mean(x)

var(x)



```

or just use:
```r
var(x)
```

You can also embed a calculation within the text to show that `r mean(x)` is the mean


2.Include equation


$$ 
E\left [var\left \{ v_1(\hat{\theta},n\vert \hat{\theta} \right \} \right ]= var\lbrace v_1(\theta_0,n)\rbrace+O(n_{-2})
$$
3.Inline equation

by online Equation Editor
$$
A\equiv[a_{i,j}]_{i,j=1...p}.
$$
